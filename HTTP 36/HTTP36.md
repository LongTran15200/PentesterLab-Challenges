# Objective

In this challenge, your goal is to send a **POST** request to /**pentesterlab** with the body of the request containing the following XML:

&lt;key value="please"&gt;&lt;/key&gt;

The request should also set the header **Content-Type** to **application/xml.**

***Using Terminal (Curl)***

**instead of using double quote("), use single quote instead so "please" can apply into the data.**
