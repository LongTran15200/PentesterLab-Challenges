# Objective

In this challenge, your goal is to send a **POST** request to /**pentesterlab** with the body of the request containing the following XML:

&lt;key&gt;&lt;value&gt;\[VALUE\]&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/key&gt;

where **\[VALUE\]** should be replaced with **&lt;please&gt;.** The request should also set the header **Content-Type** to **application/xml.**

**&lt; = &lt;; (less than in XML format) (also I'm adding extra ; so it wont apply into &gt; sign).**

**\> = &gt;; (greater than in XML format)**
