# Objective

In this challenge, your goal is to send a request to /pentesterlab using HTTP multipart.

RECOMMENDATIONS

We recommend you to solve this challenge with curl initially. Then you can write a snippet of code in your favourite language to solve it.

This will allow you to create a collection of scripts you can re-use in the future.

WRITING YOUR SCRIPT

To write your script, you can leverage your previous code for the POST requests.

***Using Terminal (curl)***

**-F(--form) = Form command- this is the means to compose a multipart mail message to transmit.**

**dummy.txt is just a random txt created with blank for this challenge and the upcoming challenge.**
