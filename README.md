<p>PentesterLab HTTP Badge is a challenge available on PentesterLab, an online platform for learning and practicing web application security testing.

The HTTP Badge challenge focuses on teaching learners about HTTP response headers, specifically the badge header, which is not a standard header but rather a custom one used by PentesterLab for the challenge. Participants are presented with a vulnerable web application and must find a way to modify the badge header to achieve certain objectives, such as gaining access to restricted content or executing arbitrary code.

The challenge is designed to simulate real-world scenarios and help learners develop their skills in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. It is suitable for anyone interested in learning more about web application security, including beginners and experienced professionals.</p>
